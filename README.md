Alerium-Productions
===================

Custom Tracks for sale for Artists to use in original music

v1.5 - Future Development
---------------------
Plans are to incorporate <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/index.html">Bootstrap</a> to provide a cleaner, more easily maintained, and more user-friendly site. The core design will likely be fairly similar.

v1.0 - November 2, 2014
---------------------
Landing page has custom music player & sales interface, through <a href="http://www.soundgine.com/">soundgine</a>. It handles everything from start to finish - previewing tracks, licensing options, purchase options, and delivery of purchased tracks. Most importantly, though, it provides an easy-to-use interface for the site owner to upload and manage content, pricing, and anything else with great ease.

The remainder of the site is used to reflect on what Alerium Productions is able to do for its customers. It provides a brief description of the company, shows some featured artists who have recorded with the company, as well as a simple contact form.
